I've made an app called Contact-Test.
This is an App that list all the contact present on your phone.
You can also call the number directly by selecting it.

Note: This is Just a freestyle app not commercial and only the code is uploaded to the repository

It was made with [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org) using frameworks like
Framework 7
Cordova Contact Plugging
Cordova Contact PhoneNumber Plugging
Cordova CallNumber Plugging
Cordova Status Plugging etc.

You can download the source code here [Cordova Contact](https://github.com/eliteaddy/Cordova-Contact)
