I've Started a project named AddyAuth.
This is just a simple website with Authentication (i.e Login, Register, Dashboard and Logout).

It was made with [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org) using 
* Express js
* Bcrypt js
* EJS (for templating)
* MongoDB 
* Passport
* Connect Flash
* Mongoose (To connect mongodb) etc.

You can check it out at [AddyAuth](https://addyauth.herokuapp.com)

Comment below on what you feel about the app.
